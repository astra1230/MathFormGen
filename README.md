# Latexify Math: Mathematical Formula Markup Revision to Assist Collaborative Editing in Math Q&A Sites
Collaborative editing questions and answers plays an important role in quality control of Mathematics StackExchange which is a math Q&A Site. Our study of post edits in Mathematics Stack Exchange shows thatthere is a large number of math-related edits about latexifying formulas, revising LaTeX and convertingthe blurred math formula screenshots to LaTeX sequence. Despite its importance, manually editing onemath-related post especially those with complex mathematical formulas is time-consuming and error-proneeven for experienced users. To assist post owners and editors to do this editing, we have developed an edit-assistance tool,MathLatexEditfor formula latexification, LaTeX revision and screenshot transcription. Weformulate this formula editing task as a translation problem, in which an original post is translated to a revisedpost.MathLatexEditimplements a deep learning based approach including two encoder-decoder models fortextual and visual LaTeX edit recommendation with math-specific inference. The two models are trained onlarge-scale historical original-edited post pairs and synthesized screenshot-formula pairs. Our evaluation ofMathLatexEditnot only demonstrates the accuracy of our model, but also the usefulness ofMathLatexEditin editing real-world posts which are accepted in Mathematics Stack Exchange.
